## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds. It helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate with teams, and manage different versions of projects efficiently.

Key features of Git:
- Tracks code history
- Supports branching and merging
- Enables collaboration via remote repositories (like GitHub)
